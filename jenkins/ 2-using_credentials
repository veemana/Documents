In Jenkins, you can configure and use various types of credentials to securely access external systems, repositories, or services. Here's how you can use credentials in Jenkins:

1. Log in to your Jenkins server and navigate to the Jenkins dashboard.

2. Click on "Credentials" in the left-hand sidebar.

3. Click on "Global credentials" to manage credentials that can be used across different jobs or pipelines.

4. Click on "Add Credentials" to create a new credential entry.

5. Select the appropriate credential type based on your use case. Jenkins supports various credential types such as Username and Password, SSH Username with private key, Secret text, Certificate, and more.

6. Fill in the required information based on the selected credential type. For example, if you choose "Username and Password", provide the username and password for the target system.

7. Optionally, provide a unique ID for the credential entry and a description for better identification.

8. Click on "OK" to save the credential entry.

Once you have defined the credentials, you can use them in your Jenkins jobs or pipelines. Here's an example of how to use credentials in a Jenkins pipeline:
